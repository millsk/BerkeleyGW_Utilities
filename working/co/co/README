ALL PATHS ARE RELATIVE TO THE DIRECTORY CONTAINING THE run.sh SCRIPT.

0) OPTIONAL: run cleanup script top 


1) Make sure that the file 'prefix' contains only the system prefix,  ie: 'co'

   echo 'co' > prefix

   *All instances of the string '!PREFIX!' (no quotes) in any file in any directory within ./ will be replaced
   with this prefix string.


2) Place all input files in the proper directories:  Required files are:
   
   1-scf/in     :  first PWSCF input file
   2-wfn/in     :  second PWSCF input file
   2-wfn/pp_in  :  pw2bgw conversion input file

3) Make sure all pseudopotential files are present in the directory ABOVE the run.sh directory.  Symbolic
links will be made to these files.

4) Run 'run.sh' to do the calculations.  Assuming all goes well, the final wavefunction file will be placed
in the root directory, appended with the prefix.

   ./run.sh
