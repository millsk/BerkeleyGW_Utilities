ALL PATHS ARE RELATIVE TO THE DIRECTORY CONTAINING THE link.sh SCRIPT.

0) OPTIONAL: run cleanup script to ensure that remnants of previous runs are not present.

1) Run 'link.sh' to create a symbolic link to the run script (run.sh).  'run.sh' must be run from 
within the same directory as link.sh, so creating the symbolic link makes it easier to remember to do 
this, and prevents a lot of copies from being created.


2) Make sure that the file 'prefix' contains only the system prefix,  ie: 'co'

   echo 'co' > prefix

   *all input files will be copied and the string '!PREFIX!' (no quotes) will be replaced with the contents
   of the file 'prefix' in the copies.  The calculations will the be run with the copied input file.


3) Place all input files in the proper directories:  Required files are:
   
   1-scf/in     :  first PWSCF input file
   2-wfn/in     :  second PWSCF input file
   2-wfn/pp_in  :  pw2bgw conversion input file


4) Make sure all pseudopotential files are present in the directory ABOVE the run.sh directory.  Symbolic
links will be made to these files.


5) Run 'run.sh' to do the calculations.  Assuming all goes well, the final wavefunction file will be placed
in the root directory, appended with the prefix.

   ./run.sh
